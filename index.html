        <h1>Islamic Perspective on Fasting</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>What is Fasting in Islam?</h2>
        <p>Fasting, known as "Sawm" in Islam, is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. It involves abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs from dawn until sunset, during the month of Ramadan.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Fasting during Ramadan was prescribed in the second year of Hijra (Migration from Mecca to Medina) in 624 CE. It commemorates the first revelation of the Quran to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>

        <h2>Key Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstaining from food, drink, smoking, and marital relations during daylight hours.</li>
            <li>Increased devotion, prayer, and recitation of the Quran.</li>
            <li>Charity and acts of kindness towards others, particularly those in need.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Spiritual Benefits</h2>
        <p>While fasting is primarily an act of worship and obedience to Allah (God), it also offers numerous spiritual benefits. It promotes self-discipline, empathy for the less fortunate, and a deeper connection with Allah.</p>
